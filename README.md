Project: Business Analysis Using Data
Problem Description:
This project aims to analyze two different business problems using data-driven approaches:

Human Resources Analysis - Data:
Problem: Understand factors affecting employee attrition and identify strategies to improve retention.
Data: Employee data including demographics, job role, performance metrics, and attrition status.
Video Games Sales - Data:
Problem: Analyze video game sales data to identify trends, popular genres, and factors influencing sales.
Data: Sales data including game title, genre, platform, region-wise sales, and critic/user ratings.
Insights Found:
Human Resources Analysis:
Employee attrition is highest among younger employees with fewer years of service.
Work-life balance and career development opportunities significantly impact employee retention.
Employees with higher performance ratings are less likely to leave the company.
Recommendations include enhancing career development programs and improving work-life balance initiatives to reduce attrition.
Video Games Sales Analysis:
Action and Shooter genres dominate video game sales across all regions.
